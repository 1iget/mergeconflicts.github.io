## Thesis

There's a well-known shortage of developers in the world. The problem is even more pronounced in the Clojure community, where this Lisp-like language suffers from a lack of understanding by the greater programming community.

Lisps have often been maligned, and functional programming with them.
Most companies prefer to use the tools and languages they are already most familiar with, leaving a Catch-22 for new languages to emerge and gain traction.

Luckily, we've seen this trend start to gradually change, with more and more firms starting to use Clojure in production.
Unfortunately, the labor market has not yet caught up with the new reality. Many employers have Clojure job listings that go unfilled. 

What are we to do about this shortage?

## Retraining

Retraining is the option most commonly used. We hire developers familiar with Java or other languages and train them in Clojure.
Pro: it's easy to find develoeprs proficient in conventional languages such as Java.
Con: the programming paradigm of Clojure is completely alien, and many imperative programmers end up gravitating towards imperative-style code, even within clojure.

## Outsourcing

Another option is outsourcing, but anyone familiar with the programming world will know that outsourcing generally means paying a premium for onshore talent, or incurring the communication and supervision overhead of managing overseas, non-native english-speaking talent.

Both of these have their own pros and cons. For some teams, going with offshore developers is the best bet. However, in the case of Clojure, it's not trivial to identify a trustworthy and reliable overseas provider.

For most companies, the prospect of hiring onshore, outsourced talent is simply cost-prohibitive.

## Continuing Education

For internal training, outside consultants can be expensive and short-term interventions don't stick in the same way that a continuous education program does.

Research has demonstrated time and again that we need to be exposed to an idea multiple times before it takes hold in our brains.

Unfortunately, no


# Body

## Point 1: 

It's very well-known that there is a global shortage of qualified developer shortage

## Point 2: Imperative transition

As many teams have observed, it can be hard to teach an old dog new tricks. Imperative programming habits have been ingrained since in most programmers.

## Point 3: 



# Conclusion
