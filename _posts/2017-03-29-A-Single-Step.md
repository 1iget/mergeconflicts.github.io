## A Long Journey

Today marks the first step of a very long journey.

We're setting out on this voyage because we firmly believe that modern software development falls far short of its true potential. It is not nearly as productive, empowering, or enjoyable as it could be.

Many disregard this prophecy, satisfied with the status quo. However, just as punch cards and COBOL have been relegated to the junk heap, so too will contemporary programming practices.

## Never Settle

We are never happy with leaving things as they are. There's always an improvement to be made. 

Are we driven by *naive perfectionism*? No. That's not it. To be a perfectionist too often means to lose perspective, the minute details demanding an outsized share of attention and care.

On the contrary, we understand that corners must sometimes be cut, that **compromises must be made** on the path towards improvement.

That said, there's a difference between a compromise and a provably inferior option. We feel a deep sense of loss when there is clearly a better, more direct path to success than the one chosen.

We claim no arrogance in this issue. We are not omniscient and are indeed ignorant in many aspects of software development and how the world works.

However, we define ourselves by our dedication to the **search for truth** above all else and believe that this pursuit will drive ourselves and our customers to walk a line closer and closer to the optimal path.

## Relentless Progress

Technological progress is a freight train that cannot be stopped, carrying us towards a future beyond human imagination. In order to grease its wheels, we stand for bringing to bear the sharpest tools, the quickest wits, and the best practices on the world's problems.

Today, that problem is Clojure programming. Tomorrow, it may be another discipline. Regardless of discipline or technology, we see our role in this world as being that of a reagent, a catalyst, an accelerator.

You, the technologists of the world, bear the responsibility of serving end users and customers. Our job is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to make them re-think what is possible. We want to actively question every assumption about what true productivity and bug-free code really mean.

### Functional Programming and Optimality

The transition from imperative to functional programming is a step in the right direction. Still, every language that we have invented so far is, sadly, deficient in some way. We would argue that this is simply the nature of things. Can human intelligence ever invent a "perfect language?" That remains to be seen.

However, rather than to navel-gaze and contemplate what the best possible language should look like, we are focused on making sure that the tools on the market today are used **properly and competently**. We've all seen the case of the rookie programer who solves the problem in 500 lines when 50 would have done the trick. 

If we extend this metaphor greatly, we think it's clear that many programming operations are not being run in an optimal manner. Whether it's through practices, training, or hiring, many software development shops are *suffering* from suboptimal productivity.

Likewise, when we look at the state of the world versus the future that we've envisioned, whether through our own optimism or through the works of fiction that we may have been exposed to, *reality falls short*.

## Are You In?

If you share this dream of the future, a future of abundance and prosperity, where opportunity truly is available for all, please be in touch.

No man, woman, or company can achieve this all on their own. 

Let's make this dream a reality, together.
